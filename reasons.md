I work on a lot of different projects. Here I list the drive behind each project, which also serves as a reminder to me of the goals of each project.

## Programming

### OurTube
I like to share music, and this provides a simpler and richer interface over chat-based commands.

### lettar & templar
Existing routing libraries, while well tested, are a little cumbersome to use. Spring requires a lot of other setup,
Sparkjava doesn't have the easy-to-use annotation-based route creation, and I haven't seen any other big libraries.
`lettar` provides the annotation-based routing, `templar` provides the server.

### incoherent-turbulence (also Unplanned Descent, Emergency Landing, Crash Course)
My primary interest in programming is making video games. These projects are game engine design iterations,
taking what I learn from reading blog posts from various game developers and trying to create something
that works well for general-purpose design.

Additionally, there's not a lot of big Java game engines, most of them are written in C++ or C#. I don't plan
to learn much about either of those languages soon, and I'd like to stick to what I know well.

### revolutionary-ring
I lose track of many things, like when I last talked to someone or when birthdays are. I can't track all of this
with a standard calendar, so this acts as a different way to organize repeating events that don't have hard due
dates.
